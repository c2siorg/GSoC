# Work Summary
As part of the "Webiu" project during my GSoC experience with C2SI, I focused on integrating real-time data and developing key frontend components for the website.

Real-Time Contributors Data
A major component of the project was implementing real-time data integration to highlight C2SI's contributors. I utilized GitHub APIs to fetch and display current contributor information, ensuring that the website accurately reflected the latest contributions. This feature provided immediate recognition of contributors’ efforts and kept the community engaged with up-to-date insights.

Frontend Development: Homepage, Community Page, and Contributor Page
In addition to backend data integration, I developed several critical frontend pages:

Homepage: I designed and developed a dynamic and visually engaging homepage that serves as the primary entry point to the website. The homepage is fully responsive, offering a seamless user experience across various devices, and provides an overview of the organization’s mission, key projects, and recent updates.

Community Page: This page focuses on showcasing C2SI’s social media presence and listing the organization's members. It provides visitors with direct links to C2SI’s social media accounts and a list of members, enhancing connectivity and promoting engagement with the broader community.

Contributor Page: Dedicated to recognizing individual contributors, this page dynamically displays real-time data on contributions using the GitHub API integration. It highlights the efforts of contributors, offering visibility and appreciation for their work, which can motivate others to participate.

These developments played a crucial role in modernizing the website and enhancing its functionality, making it a more engaging and informative platform for C2SI’s community and visitors.
